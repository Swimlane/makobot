Makobot will monitor your [Slack channels](http://slack.com) and alert you to potential threats.
Makobot will assess the risk level of any URL, IP or file that is posted by
your Slack users and give it a weather-themed score. The sunnier the better.
When you see thunder and lightning it's probably best to avoid. If the risk
level is high enough, Makobot will provide additional details about the
potential threat.

To get started check out [the documentation](https://swimlane.gitbooks.io/makobot/content/).
